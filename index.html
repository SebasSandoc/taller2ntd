                    <h2>Investigation and implementation of digital software architecture based on
                        internet of things</h2>
                    <p class="lead">
                        Application systems are becoming increasingly complex, and software system architecture plays an
                        increasingly important role in the software development process. In view of the problems of the
                        traditional software architecture, such as slow data processing speed, poor stability of the
                        architecture and low accuracy of data classification, this paper studied the digital software
                        architecture based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, and conducted data pre-processing
                        on the data collected by sensors, mainly including data reading, data cleaning, data
                        transformation and data reduction. Through experiments, it could be found that the accuracy of
                        digital software architecture using data preprocessing for data classification was more than
                        93.52%, and the average accuracy of 10 experiments was 94.55%. At the same time, the digital
                        software architecture based on the IoT was tested, and it was found that both the execution time
                        and the original memory were better than other digital software architecture. The overall
                        performance of digital software architecture based on the IoT was better.
